#MDNetworking

##Disclaimer
 *This is in no way a 1.0 codebase and I strongly recommend against you using this in production.*

##Summary
MDNetworking is a small [Apache 2.0](http://apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) licensed Cocoa / Cocoa Touch library. It is intended to be suitable for use on iOS7+ and Mac OS X 10.9+. My intention in creating this library is not to make yet another heavy Cocoa networking framework that is going to solve the meaning of life and the world's problems. I merely want to present a relatively simple and easy to use facade of NSURLConnection and the like.  

##Contributing
I'm open and welcome contributions from the community, however, any contributions that don't adhere to the present code-style will be rejected. 

##Installation
Copy over the contents of the MDNetworking folder into your project folder and add files in Xcode. Serve at room temperature. 



*As of June 10th, 2014 the Xcode 6 Beta requires you physically add the .swift files to the same directory your project code is in then manually add it to your Xcode project. You cannot just drop references into the Xcode Project*
