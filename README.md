#MDNetworking

##Disclaimer
 *This is in no way a 1.0 codebase and I strongly recommend against you using this in production.*

##Summary
MDNetworking is a small [Apache 2.0](http://apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) licensed Cocoa / Cocoa Touch library. It is intended to be suitable for use on iOS7+ and Mac OS X 10.9+. My intention in creating this library is not to make yet another heavy Cocoa networking framework that is going to solve the meaning of life and the world's problems. I merely want to present a relatively simple and easy to use facade of NSURLConnection and the like.  

##Contributing
I'm open and welcome contributions from the community, however, any contributions that don't adhere to the present code-style will be rejected. 

##Installation
Copy over the MDNetworking folder to your Swift-powered project in Xcode and serve at room temperature.
